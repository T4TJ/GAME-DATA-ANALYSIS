# GAME-DATA-ANALYSIS

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

There are two aims for this project:

1. The company want to find out the most installed game and amount it generated

2. And they also want to know the sum of each monthly revenue

I used Microsoft Power BI and Microsoft Excel to carry out this project by cleaning the raw data, and using appropriate charts, colour for the visualisation.
